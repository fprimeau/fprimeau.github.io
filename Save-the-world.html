BS in Climate Change Science and Solutions

A rebuild of current BS in ESS – ~75% of courses will come from the current BS – but will be much better focused and curated, and overall curriculum will have a clear goal/strategy/brand and architecture
Try to make a lighter major wrt to number of units and requirements – try to make it a viable second major for students in a wide range of Schools across campus, including ICS, Bio, Engineering, Social Sci, Social Ecology, Business, Public Health, etc.  Make sure it works for incoming freshmen and also transfers – make it work for students who discover it in year 2
Allow ESS to rapidly recapture the “Climate Change” brand and reestablish itself as the place for “Climate Change” research on campus
Consult widely with other Schools on campus during the development – get buy in and use this feedback to improve the plan and also to rebuild ESS visibility on campus – more generally, use the planning process to improve communication on campus
Let admin know that this is coming down the pike in ~12 months - do this before someone else grabs this space and while admin is still wandering in the dark on this issue - tell admin the goal is "a large major that serves the whole campus" 
Consult off campus – other universities – private sector – possible donors - steal any good ideas
Consider structuring to allow a 4+1 MS for students

Possible curriculum:
Year 1 - Climate Change Science and Solutions – 2-3 quarters of IPCC WG 1,2,3 – introduce to the big picture – get students motivated and hooked 
Year 2 – Tools – 2-3 quarters on data analysis, coding, field, lab – subsequent courses will use these tools - these can be tougher and may weed some students out
Year 3 – Deep dive on the physical basis of Climate change, including impacts –3 quarters refocused 51, 53, 55 - these should rely heavily on tools from year 2 - these can be 6 unit classes that include 2 lectures + 2 hour lab
Year 4 – Solutions – include capstone seminars/projects – possible intern/internal research, etc
