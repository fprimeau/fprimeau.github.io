    <h1>BS in Climate Change Science and Solutions</h1>
    <p>A rebuild of current BS in ESS – approximately 75% of 
    courses will come from the current BS – but will be much 
    better focused and curated, and overall curriculum will have a 
    clear goal/strategy/brand and architecture...</p>

    <h2>Possible curriculum:</h2>
    <h3>Year 1 - Climate Change Science and Solutions:</h3>
    <p>2-3 quarters of IPCC WG 1,2,3 – introduce to the big 
    picture – get students motivated and hooked</p>

    <h3>Year 2 – Tools :</h3>
    <p>2-3 quarters on data analysis, coding, field, lab – 
    subsequent courses will use these tools - these can be tougher 
    and may weed some students out</p>

    <h3>Year 3 – Deep Dive on The Physical Basis of Climate Change :</h3>
    <p>Deep dive on the physical basis of Climate Change, including 
    impacts –3 quarters refocused 51, 53, 55 - these should rely 
    heavily on tools from year 2 - these can be 6 unit classes that 
    include 2 lectures + 2 hour lab</p>

    <h3>Year 4 – Solutions :</h3>
    <p>Solutions – include capstone seminars/projects – possible intern/internal 
    research, etc.</p>
